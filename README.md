## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This project has allowed me to really focus on refactoring the Javascript. On the one hand I sought to remove heavy HTML markdown by bringing iterable content to the Javascript, to imitate a React component, and on the other I broke down larger functions such as the email verification function int smaller function to improve readability.

With almost a thousand line of CSS for a fairly simple landing page, this project showed me how time-saving CSS frameworks can be.

I am especially interested in continuing to improve the scalability of my projects across difference screen sizes as this proved more time-consuming than expected.
